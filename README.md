Introduction
This project, RandomGuessNumber, implements a simple guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified number of attempts. The game provides an interactive experience for users to test their guessing skills and aims to entertain and engage players of all ages.                                                                                                                            

Features
•	Random Number Generation: Generates a random number within a specified range for the user to guess.                                                                                                                
•	Limited Attempts: Users have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.                                                                                                                             
•	User Feedback: Provides feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.                                                                                      
•	User-Friendly Interface: Offers a straightforward and intuitive interface for users to interact with during the game.                                                                                              

Usage
•	To enjoy the game, follow these steps:                                                                                                                                                                             
•	Clone the repository to your local machine.                                                                                                                                                                        
•	Compile the Java source files using a Java compiler (e.g., javac).                                                                                                                                                 
•	Run the Main class to start the game interface.                                                                                                                                                                    
•	Follow the on-screen instructions to make guesses and try to guess the random number within the specified attempts.

How it Works                                                                                                                                                                                                       
   The Main class initializes the game by generating a random number within the specified range. It then prompts the user to make guesses within the allotted attempts. After each guess, the program provides feedback to the user, guiding them towards the correct answer. The game ends when the user either guesses the correct number or exhausts all attempts.
